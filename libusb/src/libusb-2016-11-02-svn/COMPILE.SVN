To compile libusb from SVN:

./autogen.sh
make

If you update the sources from SVN and things are acting weird, try running
autogen.sh again.

NOTE: automake 1.8 (or possibly newer) is required
NOTE: autoconf 2.59 (or possibly newer) is required

If you have problems, try removing all files and directories named *.cache:
rm -rf *.cache
