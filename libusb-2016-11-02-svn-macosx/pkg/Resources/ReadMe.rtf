\cf0 Please make sure to include:\
\
\'a5	The version of libusb\
\
\'a5	Information about your system. For instance:\
\
	\'d0	What operating system and version\
	\'d0	For Linux, what version of the C library\
\
	And anything else you think is relevant.\
\
\'a5	How to reproduce the bug. \
\
\	If you can reproduce it with the testlibusb program that is built in the libusb/ directory, that will be most convenient. Otherwise, please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software that can be downloaded.\
\
\'a5	If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the crash occured.\
\
\'a5	Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not necessary.\

\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 Building\
\pard\qj

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 \
It should be as simple as running these two commands:\
\
./configure\
make\
\
One common problem is building the SGML documentation. On some systems, like SuSE, you will need to set the SGML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to something similar to this (actual paths may vary):\
\
export SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/usr/share/sgml/CATALOG.docbook_3:/usr/share/sgml/CATALOG.docbook-dsssl-stylesheets:/usr/share/sgml/openjade/catalog"\
\
On recent versions of Fedora Core (FC5 Test 2 atleast), this command may be\
needed:\
\
export SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/catalog"\
\
or possibly:\
\
export SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/docbook"\

\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 C++ Support\
\pard\qj

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 \
There are reasonable unit tests available \'d1 run \'d2make check\'d3 to do the tests. Note that some of the tests will unexpectedly pass if you don\'d5t have a specfic type of Logitech mouse connected, and some are expected to fail unless you are running as root (or otherwise have permissions to access the device).\
\
Building the C++ documentation requires Doxygen ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/"}}{\fldrslt http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}})}
