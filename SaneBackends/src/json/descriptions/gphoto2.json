{"comment": "The long-term plan is to support all the cameras supported by the gphoto2 libraries (currently over 140 models). However, at this stage, only a handful of cameras are definitely known to work with SANE. Other cameras will probably work if the native file format is EXIF or JPEG. Testers welcome!"}
